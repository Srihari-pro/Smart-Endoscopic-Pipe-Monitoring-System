# Smart-Endoscopic-Pipe-Monitoring-System
Real-time pipe inspection system using OpenCV and camera input to detect cracks and blockages inside pipelines.

The Smart Endoscopic Pipe Monitoring System is designed for real-time inspection of pipelines to detect cracks and blockages using computer vision techniques. A camera module mounted on a robotic arm captures live video from inside the pipe, which is processed using OpenCV in Python to automatically identify structural defects. Detected defects are highlighted on the live display, reducing manual inspection and improving safety and efficiency.
